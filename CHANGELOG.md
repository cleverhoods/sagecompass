# SageCompass changelog
## v5.0 - alpha1
- Implement LangGraph solution
- Vastly reduce the size of the project
- Reorganize agents
## v4.0 - alpha5
- Reorganize project → each agent in its own folder (/agents/{agent}/)
- Keep utils/ for infrastructure and drop DI concepts
- Redefine BaseAgent → now CoreAgent with full PRAL and hooks
- Finalize FileLoader + ProviderFactory (core bootstrapping)
  - updated: ProviderFactory now reads params: sub-block from YAML and handles LangChain v1 modules dynamically. 
  - updated: FileLoader and AgentLoader support flat agent.yaml / schema.json / system.prompt layout.
- Lifecycle (config → prompt → schema → execution → validation)
- Load agent config and model via ProviderFactory
- Load system + agent prompts via FileLoader and AgentLoader
- Schema validation via ValidationService
- PRAL loop (perceive → reason → act → learn) implemented and validated end-to-end
- Logging for PRAL stages and agent I/O - Hook-based execution replaces _default methods; system_prompt is merged (core + agent).
- SageCompass.ask() refactored for sequential agent handoff
- Shared state dictionary for intermediate results
- Schema validation between agent outputs/inputs

## v4.0 - alpha4
- Moved provider config under config/
- Added 'agent' config
- Updated yaml configuration data structures
- Renamed and reworked logic.py to orchestrator.py
- Generalised prompt_ and config_loader. The new util is file_loader.py.
- Introduced DEFAULT_PROVIDER envvar
- Rewrite agents/base.py to comply with generic agent abstraction (PRAL)
- Rewrite agents/problem_framing.py to comply with base.py abstraction

## v4.0 - alpha3
- Created BaseAgent abstract class
- Implemented basic PRAL
- Implemented *_shared* and *problem_framing* Schemas and their validation
- Added event_logger, retriever and validator utility
- Updated prompt_loader and config loader utilities with event_logger
- Added SAGECOMPASS_ENV environmental value for event log verbosity
- Created ProblemFramingAgent
- logic.py renamed to chain.py, reworked previous orchestration
- Updated system.prompt and created problem_framing.prompt
- Updated README.md
- Created LEARNING.md to store certain learning materials

## v4.0 - alpha2
- Rework ddev integration into a separate Python service
- Replacing requirements.txt with Potery (pyproject.toml) to manage project requirements.
- Added new ddev command: ddev poetry
- Fine-tuning python compose to manage Poetry and Python cache

## v4.0 - alpha1 
- Adding DDev environment (generic, with python 3 installed on web)
- Adding Python project necessities (requirements.txt)
- Reorganising project setup (configs, prompts, providers, utils, main/logic and ui.py)
