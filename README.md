# SageCompass
SageCompass is an augmented decision system that checks whether a business idea actually needs AI 
before anyone spends time and money building it.

## You Do What?
“It’s a virtual consultant that applies consistent logic to every AI idea and tells you — with numbers — if it’s worth doing or not.”

| Consultant asking “What problem are we solving?”    | Stage 1 – Problem framing & information gathering |
| Analyst turning that into measurable goals          | Stage 2 – Goals & KPIs                            |
| Data scientist checking “Do we have data for this?” | Stage 3 – Feasibility                             |
| Executive deciding “Is this worth doing?”           | Stage 4 – Decision synthesis                      |
