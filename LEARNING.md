## PRAL (Perceive, Reason, Act, Learn) - cycle
- It's the AI Agent cognitive cycle:
  - `perceive()` – gather user input + context (MCP/Knowledge).
  - `reason()` – interpret, plan, and prepare structured intent.
  - `act()` – call tools or LLM to generate output.
  - `learn()` – validate, log, and refine for next run.
