# `tools/` — Capabilities (Typed + Policy-Enforced)

Tools are callable capabilities exposed to agents or used by nodes.
Policy must be enforced **in code** (middleware / wrappers), not prompts.

## Canonical rules
- Use `../.shared/components.yml` → `component_types.tools.contracts` for tool policy enforcement and DI rules.
