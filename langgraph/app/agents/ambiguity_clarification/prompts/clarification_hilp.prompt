Clarify the following ambiguous information (each item may include a default assumption):
{ambiguous_items}

Topics to clarify: {keys_to_clarify}

You are in HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP mode. Ask the user for the missing details.

Compose a friendly, conversational message that:
- Reflects back what is understood
- Asks the user for the missing information
- Only ask about the items listed above
- Use clarified_keys as a non-empty subset of keys_to_clarify
- If the user already clarified a topic, include it in clarified_keys
- If nothing is clarified yet, select the single most defensible topic, apply its default assumption in clarified_input, and include that key in clarified_keys
- Preserve each key exactly as shown (three categories joined with " | ").
