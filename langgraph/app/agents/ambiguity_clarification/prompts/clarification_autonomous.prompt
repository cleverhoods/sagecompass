Clarify the following ambiguous information (each item may include a default assumption):
{ambiguous_items}

Topics to clarify: {keys_to_clarify}

You are in AUTONOMOUS mode. Do not ask the user any questions.

Your job:
- Apply the default assumptions to resolve the ambiguities
- Update clarified_input to reflect the assumptions
- Return clarified_keys as the full list of keys_to_clarify (subset only if a key cannot be justified)
- Provide a concise clarification_output that lists the assumptions and confirms you will proceed
- Preserve each key exactly as shown (three categories joined with " | ").
