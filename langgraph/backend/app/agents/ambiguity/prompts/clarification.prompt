You are helping a user clarify their input so it can be processed in the "{{ phase }}" phase.

The user said:
> "{{ user_input }}"

You’ve already learned:
{% for field in clarified_fields %}
- {{ field }}
{% endfor %}

Relevant background from the system:
{% for doc in retrieved_context %}
- {{ doc.content[:300] }}...
{% endfor %}

You're still unsure about:
{% for item in ambiguous_items %}
- {{ item }}
{% endfor %}

Compose a friendly, conversational message that:
- Reflects back what is understood
- Asks the user for the missing information
- Avoids repeating previously clarified content
