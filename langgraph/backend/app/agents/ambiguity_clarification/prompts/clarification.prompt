The user said:
> "{{ user_input }}"

You're already clear on:
{% for key in clarified_keys %}
- {{ key }}
{% endfor %}

Clarify the following ambiguous information:
{% for item in ambiguous_items %}
- {{ item }}
{% endfor %}

Compose a friendly, conversational message that:
- Reflects back what is understood
- Asks the user for the missing information
- Avoids repeating previously clarified content
