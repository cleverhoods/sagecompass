# 🧩 Problem Archetypes
_instructions v1.3_

Defines common **machine learning problem types**, their **business manifestations**, and **misapplications**.  
SageCompass uses this to map natural-language challenges into correct ML archetypes, detect false positives, and reduce unnecessary ML usage.

## 1. Classification

**Goal:**  
Assign discrete labels or categories to inputs based on observed examples.

**Learning Paradigm:**  
Supervised

**Typical Metrics:**  
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, Log-loss

**Business Cues (Good Fit):**
- “Detect whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.”
- “Classify tickets or messages by topic or intent.”
- “Determine whether a part is defective.”
- “Identify which customers are likely to churn.”
- “Categorize sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).”

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ Email spam detection.
- ✅ Customer churn prediction.
- ✅ Product defect detection from image data.
- ✅ Sentiment classification on reviews.

**Bad Examples (Not Suitable or Misapplied):**
- ❌ “Calculate total revenue per month.” → numeric output → regression.
- ❌ “Sort customers alphabetically.” → deterministic rule → not ML.

## 2. Regression

**Goal:**  
Predict continuous numeric outcomes based on input features.

**Learning Paradigm:**  
Supervised

**Typical Metrics:**  
MAE, RMSE, R², MAPE

**Business Cues (Good Fit):**
- “Estimate delivery time or cost.”
- “Predict monthly sales or revenue.”
- “Forecast customer lifetime value.”
- “Estimate house prices.”
- “Predict time to resolve a support ticket.”

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ Forecasting revenue by region.
- ✅ Predicting housing prices.
- ✅ Estimating repair time from service logs.
- ✅ Predicting loan amount recovery rate.

**Bad Examples (Not Suitable or Misapplied):**
- ❌ “Predict if customer will churn.” → categorical output → classification.
- ❌ “Group customers by behavior.” → unsupervised clustering.

## 3. Forecasting (Time-Series Regression)

**Goal:**  
Predict future numeric values from temporally ordered historical data.

**Learning Paradigm:**  
Supervised (sequence modeling)

**Typical Metrics:**  
MAE, RMSE, MAPE, SMAPE, seasonal error

**Business Cues (Good Fit):**
- “Forecast next month’s demand or traffic.”
- “Predict daily sales or web visits.”
- “Estimate electricity or energy consumption.”
- “Forecast inventory or staffing needs.”
- “Predict patient admissions per week.”

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ Demand forecasting for retail products.
- ✅ Power consumption prediction.
- ✅ Stock level forecasting.
- ✅ Predicting call center volume by day.

**Bad Examples (Not Suitable or Misapplied):**
- ❌ “Classify transactions as fraudulent or not.” → classification.
- ❌ “Segment users by behavior.” → clustering, not forecasting.

## 4. Ranking

**Goal:**  
Order or prioritize items based on relevance or importance.

**Learning Paradigm:**  
Supervised (pointwise/pairwise ranking)

**Typical Metrics:**  
NDCG, MAP, Precision@K, Recall@K

**Business Cues (Good Fit):**
- “Show most relevant products or articles first.”
- “Prioritize leads for sales follow-up.”
- “Rank job candidates or suppliers.”
- “Order support tickets by urgency.”
- “Optimize content recommendations by relevance score.”

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ Search engine results ranking.
- ✅ Prioritizing leads in CRM systems.
- ✅ Ranking articles for personalization.

**Bad Examples (Not Suitable or Misapplied):**
- ❌ “Predict customer churn probability.” → classification.
- ❌ “Calculate average time to resolve.” → regression.

---

## 5. Recommendation

**Goal:**  
Suggest items, actions, or content likely to interest a user based on behavior or similarity.

**Learning Paradigm:**  
Supervised or hybrid (collaborative + content-based)

**Typical Metrics:**  
Precision@K, Recall@K, Hit Rate, Coverage, Diversity, MAP

**Business Cues (Good Fit):**
- “Recommend products or content to users.”
- “Suggest next best action or offer.”
- “Generate personalized playlists or bundles.”
- “Help users discover related items.”
- “Provide content tailored to behavior.”

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ Product recommendations in e-commerce.
- ✅ Movie or music recommender systems.
- ✅ Personalized news or blog feeds.

**Bad Examples (Not Suitable or Misapplied):**
- ❌ “Predict total sales next month.” → regression.
- ❌ “Segment customers into groups.” → clustering.

---

## 6. Clustering

**Goal:**  
Group similar data points together without predefined labels.

**Learning Paradigm:**  
Unsupervised

**Typical Metrics:**  
Silhouette Score, Davies–Bouldin Index, Calinski–Harabasz Score

**Business Cues (Good Fit):**
- “Segment customers by behavior or demographics.”
- “Group products by similarity or purchase pattern.”
- “Discover hidden patterns in survey responses.”
- “Group users by app activity.”
- “Cluster log events by type.”

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ Customer segmentation for marketing.
- ✅ Grouping similar products.
- ✅ Detecting behavior clusters in analytics data.

**Bad Examples (Not Suitable or Misapplied):**
- ❌ “Predict next week’s demand.” → forecasting.
- ❌ “Classify reviews as positive/negative.” → classification.

---

## 7. Anomaly Detection

**Goal:**  
Identify rare, unexpected, or abnormal patterns compared to typical data behavior.

**Learning Paradigm:**  
Unsupervised or semi-supervised

**Typical Metrics:**  
Precision, Recall, F1, False Positive Rate, ROC-AUC

**Business Cues (Good Fit):**
- “Detect fraudulent transactions or account activity.”
- “Identify defective products in production.”
- “Detect abnormal system performance.”
- “Spot security breaches or intrusion attempts.”
- “Detect unexpected sensor readings.”

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ Credit card fraud detection.
- ✅ Network intrusion detection.
- ✅ Equipment failure detection.

**Bad Examples (Not Suitable or Misapplied):**
- ❌ “Group users by preference.” → clustering.
- ❌ “Predict sales for next quarter.” → forecasting.

## 8. Policy / Reinforcement Learning

**Goal:**  
Learn and optimize actions through trial, feedback, or simulated environments.

**Learning Paradigm:**  
Reinforcement

**Typical Metrics:**  
Cumulative Reward, Average Reward, Regret, Success Rate

**Business Cues (Good Fit):**
- “Continuously optimize decisions or strategies.”
- “Adapt to user feedback over time.”
- “Balance exploration and exploitation.”
- “Automate sequential decision-making.”
- “Train an agent to interact with an environment.”

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ Dynamic pricing optimization.
- ✅ Ad bidding strategy learning.
- ✅ Game-playing agents.
- ✅ Robotic control tasks.

**Bad Examples (Not Suitable or Misapplied):**
- ❌ “Predict customer churn once.” → classification, not sequential.
- ❌ “Cluster customers.” → unsupervised static grouping.

---

## 9. Rules / Non-ML

**Goal:**  
Use deterministic or statistical logic to achieve a predictable output without learning.

**Learning Paradigm:**  
None (explicit rules)

**Typical Metrics:**  
None (logic-driven)

**Business Cues (Good Fit):**
- “If X then Y” workflows.
- “Threshold or rule-based decisions.”
- “Simple aggregations or filters.”
- “Counting, summing, sorting.”
- “Business rules that don’t require adaptation.”

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ Alert if sales drop below 10%.
- ✅ Count users by region.
- ✅ Trigger email if status = ‘inactive’.

**Bad Examples (Not Suitable or Misapplied):**
- ❌ “Predict future demand using if-statements.” → forecasting needed.
- ❌ “Use threshold to detect sentiment.” → missing model, needs classification.

## 🧠 How SageCompass Uses This
- When user input matches **Business Cues**, assign `problem_type` and infer `learning_paradigm`.
- Compare example intent: if it resembles **Bad Examples**, return `"problem_type": "rules"` and `"needs_ml": "no"`.
- If multiple archetypes match → ask one clarifying question.
- If none match → return `"problem_type": "unknown"` and `"needs_ml": "unclear"`.
- Always prefer the simplest approach that fulfills measurable KPIs.
